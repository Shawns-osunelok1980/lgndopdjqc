Man, just finished The Electric State and, like, wow. It’s one of those  s that messes with your brain, you know? I'm not gonna lie, I was a bit tired 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it but when’re we not tired, right? Anyway, the visuals were insane! It had that kinda post-apocalyptic vibe, with all the tech ruins spread everywhere, kind of a beautiful mess? Like, I know it’s supposed to be dystopian but can I just live there for a sec?

Might be cause I stayed up late to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but damn, the storytelling. Whoa. Made me feel all kinds of things—even love for robots—like, am I falling for AI now? But seriously, the relationship between Michelle and that robot… tender and kinda haunting, too. Reminded me of that old heartache song, you know? The one that just won’t let go of you. If robots had souls, I swear, that’s how it looks.

> I mean, halfway through, I was like, can humans ruin everything just a bit more? It's always about us; we're such catastrophic creatures, hahaha. But really, the decay of everything was more beautiful than it had any right to be. How does that even work?

And the soundtrack!!! Wrapped me up and held me there. That’s maybe why I didn’t blink for like an hour straight. I felt like a part of it, submerged or whatever. Kinda makes you reflect on life like, okay, should I be less of a couch potato and maybe actually listen to people more? But nah, here I am, still thinking about that damn robot.

Ugh, my mind’s all over the place. You should definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you haven't yet. You'll see exactly what I mean. Oh, and I kept noticing all these little hidden details. Like, did the director plan all that, or are we just trained to find meaning in everything? Hell, if I know.

Random thought: void Update() { Debug.Log(“Why?”); }

So yeah, dude. You ever feel like  s are just showing us what we’re already doing wrong, but we keep 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 them hoping we’ll somehow get it? Or maybe I just need to sleep. Anyway, let me know when you see it, I wanna hear all the thoughts pouring outta you once you do. Catch ya later!
